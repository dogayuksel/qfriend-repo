    content: "Tonight and into new years partying, here it is!\n🚀Berghain / Panorama Bar ⛓\nUltimate lineup, ultimate queue. Hopefully you bought presale tickets inside the club in the weeks beforehand; if not (or perhaps even with presaled tickets) this could possibly be the world's toughest entry, period.\nInside? well...\n🚀Festsaal Kreuzberg⛓\nTekknozid - Oldschool Rave 30.12.2017 - Start 21 Uhr\nBasically does what it says on the tin; this is an oldskool style techno rave done in 90s throwback production styles. To be honest, this is in so many ways a good idea, especially with the ideas of incorporating visuals and making the entire environment more immersive. Classic rave anthems all night probably won't hurt the cause either.\n🚀Griessmuehle⛓\nDiversity closing 2017 w / Roy Davis Jr x San Proper\nRolling disco and house, as should be heard on a Brooklyn rooftop when done to perfection.\nEither your idea of a good time, or something you'd probably skip.\n☞Club GRETCHEN\n☞Acid Arab & Rozzma\nAcid Arab is basically an all around cool motherfucker, so we trust him to do what's right and correct in this situation.\n☞Loftus Hall\n☞Karma.Love - Episode Berlin\nThis is basically going to be a middle-of-the-winter, indoor version of ''the chillout stage''at most German/Croatian/European dance music festivals that take place all over the summer. Also think about the sounds you hear occasionally at places like the Sisyphos Wintergarten. As it states, expect chill vibes and glitter.\n☞Suicide Circus Berlin\n☞Suicide Club with The Godfather of House - Marshall Jefferson\nI mean, Marshall Jefferson. When else are you going to see him? \nGo dance to a Marshall Jefferson DJ set, whatever that even is at this point. Who knows? But give this a shot, I promise.\n☞Salon - Zur wilden Renate\n☞Oben Unten Überall /w. Stefan Goldmann, Daniela La Luz & more\nA heads-down, intelligent booking in Renate tonight, with a multitude of artists known for pushing boundaries within their crafts. Also interesting is what's farther down on the bill; a 'little known name from out of town' who's other project is a well-known more commercial alias called 'the glitz.'\n☞Tresor.Berlin (OFFICIAL)\n☞Final Knall\nThe amazing Gunner Haslam is upstairs in Globus, which is the first sign that this party, while at Tresor, will still at minimum have extremely good music happening in it. Traversable Wormhole, Paula Temple et al come through with the super weird heavy dark shit downstairs.\n☞watergate club 'official'\n☞Day 4 w/ Derrick May Butch Kiasmos Francesco Tristano and more\nIt's Derrick May. Butch is there too and a bunch of other people whom you may or may not care about. But you have a chance to see Derrick May play in a club on NYE weekend in Berlin. Never a bad bet. Be wary of the expensive drinks and sometimes queue headaches that come with Watergate and it's situation/location.\nEnjoy New Years folks! 👀",

    content: 'Vybz tonight at:\n🚤🛥🚢://about party\nRoom 4 Resistance Sylvester Rave Queerness\nRoom For Resistance is a progressive and left-of-center crew dedicated to giving space in the Berlin club scene to marginalized voices. Their parties are well-attended, welcoming, and raucous. The weather is a bit cold and foggy, so expect the inside areas to be packed. If you go, be sure to check out the Canadian DJ Peach and the Kazakhstani DJ Nazira.\n🚤🛥🚢IPSE\nRIOT #10 [Extended Edition]\nIpse is a place known for low-volume sound, high-priced drinks, and lots of tourists. The best time to go is summer, when you can catch riverside vibes and sunrises. So why head over there now? Simply: the DJs and promoters in charge tonight know what they’re doing. A collaboration between the CockTail D’Amore, Buttons, and Same Bitches crews, tonight’s party brings a welcome bit of edginess to Schlesi.\n🚤🛥🚢Salon - Zur wilden Renate\nHenriette House /w. South London Ordnance, Diego Krause & more\nRenate! The ‘house-party club’ marches into 2018 with more quirkiness and Victorian furniture. They might have the most well-rounded lineup of the night as well; South London Ordnance and Diego Krause bring the big-room trax and name recognition, but as always in Renate the smaller rooms are sometimes even more fun. One of them is gonna’ be full of people playing deep disco and psych stuff, while the other will be controlled by the all-female Frauengedeck crew.\nYou can’t lose.\nInto the Woods Berlin w/ Praslea, Thomas Melchior, Audio Werner & more\nTBA\nWell, if the Hoppetosse and Finest Fridays crowds seem a little light this weekend, it’s because this thing called Into The Woods is happening. Headed by the microhouse master and frequent Perlon collaborator Thomas Melchior, this party is for those who like it deep and and minimal and don’t mind heading a bit outside the standard Berlin club orbit. If this isn’t your thing, we understand, but for others...there’s no place else to be this weekend.\nChalet Club "Official"\nNYE WEEK NYC 2017\nYes, sometimes Chalet has its share of tourists. Sometimes the queue is long. But they have a roaring fire and a Funktion One and sometimes the vibe in there can’t be beat. Beat the tourist crowd by heading over there tonight; Tom Trago from Trouw and Rush Hour records in Amsterdam will be doing his thing, and Bambounou will bring the French bassy weirdness. Worth your time.\nArena Club\nDystopian w/ Keith Carnal, Tijana T, Mirella Kroes, Don Williams and Ron Albrecht\nYep, this is the techno party. If you’re familiar with Arena Club, you might know that most of the Berghain-worthy techno DJs and labels have events here on the regular. It works well; the building is all concrete and brick and creates a great little echo and reverb perfect for that kind of sound. Tonight’s guests are the mighty mighty Dystopian label; home to giants like Monoloc, Recondite, Phase, and Rodhad. Sadly most of these big names are off to chase big NYE bookings in other cities, but Keith Carnal is guesting and the Dystopian residents will surely hold it down. Recommended if you plan to wear all black tonight.\nGriessmuehle\nSlave To The Rave | Ansome, Charlton, Mørbeck b2b UBH & more\nSo this is the party for you if you like house and techno music, but you also like new music. Just look at the flyer for the event; it’s similar to the visual treatments on records at places like Phonica in London or Sound Metaphors here in Berlin. Recommended if you like Perc Trax as a label or wear Reebok Classics.\nHoppetosse\nRoaring Fourties\nHoppetosse is about as romantic as Berlin can get sometimes. It’s a rave on a beautiful old boat in the middle of the city, and it closes when they feel like it. The music is a bit minimal for some tastes, but at minimum it’s classy and functional. When it’s on, it’s really on. Also recommended for those who aren’t much into ‘traditional clubs’; half of the space is a fairly well-lit ‘chill room,’ and in most cases the music isn’t very loud. Johnny D and Einzelkind will surely bring some jams, so if you’re down to party for a long time on a boat...give this one a shot.',

    content: 'Hello Friends! Bored with christmas but in the Saturday spirit? 🍶👟\nSTAUB techno at ://about party\nSTAUB is up there in the Pornceptual/Homopatik universe of young, edgy techno parties in Berlin. Virtually an institution at this point, STAUB doesn’t publish lineups or do much in the way of traditional promotion. Expect a young, queer, and fashion-forward crowd getting it in to some strong kick drums.\nDJ Sirio and Ebrian, Promenaden Eck\nNow, for something completely different. This is a bar in Neukoelln with a hip hop room and a house/techno room. There’s usually 2-3 Euros cover at the door to pay the DJ’s, and most of the music you hear will be pretty easy to wrap your head around. The PA/sound system can barely be described as adequate. Drinks are cheap. (There’s no need to be serious all of the time.)\nEnjoy the week-end! 👀',

    content: '➬ Not sure where to jack tonight? ➫\nThis Friday our fav spots are:\n// Mannequin Record Night at Berghain / Panorama Bar //\nMannequin (Label + Mailorder) might be best known in 2017 as discoverers of ‘S U R V I V E,’ the spacey Austin band now known worldwide for their musical scoring of ‘Stranger Things.’ They won’t be in Berghain tonight, but that kind of vibe will be. If you like darkwave, EBM, and experimental electronic stuff that sounds similar, this is the night for you. Fittingly, this party takes place in ‘Säule,’ the new-ish ground floor event space in Berghain for left-of-center music.\n// Kassem Mosse, MADTEO et al, at ://about party //\nKassem Mosse is best known for nerdy, experimental house trax. However, his DJ sets go farther than that. Playing regularly with guys like Mix Mup and Ben UFO, the man from Leipzig also has no problem dropping lean techno cuts or thicker UK bass into the mix. Expect a sweaty and crowded mess.\n// San Soda 4HR set at Prince Charles //\nSan Soda is a Belgian selector who reps the aptly named We Play House label, and the theme of tonight is House of Love. Basically, if you like beautiful, canonical house music, this is yours. Prince Charles can be a little snobby and a little pricey for some tastes, but when they have good DJ’s on the decks it can still be a great time.\n// Surgeon, Dasha Rush, Dj Pete, at Tresor.Berlin (OFFICIAL) //\nYes, Tresor is usually full of tourists, but with their booking policy and their label still going so strong they’re worth more than a mention. Tonight it’ll be heavy, heads-down techno from Surgeon and Dasha Rush. Recommended if that’s your thing, and don’t forget to check out DJ Pete. He’s part of the Hard Wax crew so his sets tend to lean dubby/heady.\nHave a great night, for more, come back tomorrow! 👀',

    content: "Not sure what happened to our yesterday’s suggestions, but here we are, Saturday bounce! ✌️\nTLDR; About Blank, Berghain, Griessmühle, Liquid Sky Berlin, Hoppetosse, Loftus Hall!\nJob Jobse + others, Buttons @aboutparty\nFor those not as into the idea of traveling outside the city center, there's always the Buttons party at about.blank. A solid booking policy + an edgy, predominantly-gay crowd means Buttons is a favourite of many in Berlin. This time they have Job Jobse, best known as a resident at Trouw and De School in Amsterdam. Usually a mix of straightahead house and techno.\nProsumer et al Griessmuehle\nProsumer isn't well-known to casual dance music fans as he's never scored high on those various 'DJ Ranking' lists. Don't worry about that. He was a resident in Panoramabar for years, so he very much knows how to play clean and classic house music. Check him out if you like that kind of thing.\nShifted et al Berghain / Panorama Bar\nNot much new can be said about the Saturday-into-Monday-ish thing that is a club night at Berghain/PBar. Expect a long queue, a tough door, and hedonism inside.\nÜmit Han presents: Experimental Live Film Scoring Night Liquidsky Berlin\nThis one's for people into something a bit different and a bit weird. Liquid Sky Berlin made waves a few months ago when their 'no record players,no CDJs' policy went viral. Instead of DJs working with standard equipment, expect experimental live electronics that may or may not even be danceable. Close-knit, well-informed, heads-down crowd.\nTonight electronic musicians play improvised sounds in real time while visual artists remix and glitch a film on a projector.\nDana Ruh, Matthew Jonson etc Hoppetosse\nHoppetosse and its sister CDV are the outposts for the stripped-down and minimal microhouse pioneered by Perlon Records and Ricardo Villalobos starting in the 2000s. This weekend their minimal formula gets a bit of a colour injection due to the appearance of the wonderful Mr. Jonson + friends. Recommended.\nIf you are looking for some more friendly chill vibes, we suggest to check out Loftus Hall.\nEnjoy the weekend! 👀",
